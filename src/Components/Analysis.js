        <h6>Oakland Raiders @ Kansas City Chiefs</h6>
        <p>"Expect Derek Carr and co to be challenged this weekend. But then, they have overcome almost every challenge so far this season. Still, I would expect slightly less production from Carr and Amari Cooper. Michael Crabtree should be good to continue his impressively consistent output this week. Alex Smith is not the worst QB you can start. He is udner the radar, but the Raiders D is susceptible. If your usual starter has a tough game, Smith could do you some good. Spencer Ware is a must start right now. He is playing well, look for it to continue."</p>

        <h6>Pittsburgh Steelers @ Buffalo Bills</h6>
        <p>"LeVeon Bell is a must start, as is Antonio Brown. Big Ben on the otherhand should sit this week. Playing Buffalo away can be tough. Use your backup QB if you trust him. Tyrod Taylor was decent against the Raiders. Sit him this week though. This has a low scoring passing affair on the cards. LeSean McCoy is running hard. Start him."</p>

        <h6>San Diego Chargers @ Carolina Panthers</h6>
        <p>"The Chargers have been fantasy friendly all season. Should there be any reason for that to change against a crestfallen Panthers D? Nope. Play your more reliable Chargers players. Cam Newton and Greg Olsen should start this week. They will put up points. Jonathan Stewart and Kelvin Benjamin are riskier. If you have a more viable option go for it. It would be unwise to potentially place your playoff hopes on these two."</p>

        <h6>Cincinnati Bengals @ Cleveland Browns</h6>
        <p>"Dalton start. Hill start. Eifert start. Bengals D start. Browns sit. Browns sit. Browns sit. Browns sit. Incdluding Terelle Pryor."</p>


        <h6>Chicago Bears @ Detroit Lions</h6>
        <p>"This one is tricky. The Bears D is actually not bad, but the Lions are at home and they are on form. I would cautiously start Matt Stafford. Keep their running backs on your bench. Use Golden Tate as a flex. Jordan Howard is pretty much a must start at this point. Other than him, the Bears will post low output this Sunday."</p>

        <h6>Houston Texans @ Indianapolis Colts</h6>
        <p>"The Texans are not a fantasy friendly team this season. Nonetheless, Lamar Miller is worth starting this weekend. The Colts are getting hot. I am leaning more towards starting their main guys this week. Frank Gore will probably post you around eleven points. Luck, Hilton, Moncrief and Allen all could play big. I am in on the Colts."</p>

        <h6>Minnesota Vikings @ Jacksonville Jaguars</h6>
        <p>"It is too hard to trust the Vikings offense right now. The only player with any significant fantasy potential for you is Stefon Diggs and the Jaguars pass D is surprisingly effective. As for Jacksonville, they are up against a very good Vikings D. Play Allen Robinson and Allen Hurns only if you are very confident in the rest of your lineup."</p>

        <h6>Arizona Cardinals @ Miami Dolphins</h6>
        <p>"David Johnson is the most obvious start in the league right now. Avoid Carson Palmer as long as your alternative QB is adequate. Starting any Cardinals WR will be a risk I am not willing to take right now. Miami have some players to light up your team right now. Expect a better performance from Jay Ajayi this week. Ryan Tannehill should play better as well. Jarvis Landry will pull in a few points for sure with potential for close to thirteen points."</p>

        <h6>Washington Redskins @ Philadelphia Eagles</h6>
        <p>"Kirk Cousins is having a good year. Keep relying on him for now. Jamison Crowder is a clear start. Keep an eye on Jordan Reeds status. Do not let your playoff hopes rely on him. There are better options than Carson Wentz on your waiver wire right now. Ryan Mathews is an excellent start this week. Definitely play him. Play Jordan Mathews if your thin at WR, but plan for lower output from him this week."</p>

        <h6>Denver Broncos @ Tennessee Titans</h6>
        <p>"Best not to plan on starting Siemien this week. Playing either Devonta Booker or CJ Anderson is a gamble as they are a committee. Playing either could pay off for you though. Consider how costly a loss of points will be in your matchup if you start one of them and they are low scoring. Marcus Mariota will be less busy this Sunday. Broncos have a good pass D, but a bad run D. That means DeMarco Murray should be a definite starter for you, unless you have some very very good alternatives. Murray would be high on my list of starters however. Avoid Titans WRs this week. Delanie Walker is the exception."</p>

        <h6>New York Jets @ San Francisco 49 ers</h6>
        <p>"Whoever the Jets QB is, just play someone else. He will not throw eight TDs, even against SF. Pick a different QB. Matt Forte start for sure. Carlos Hyde should have a good game and Vance McDonald could put up some numbers. Expect less fantasy value in this game."</p>

        <h6>Seattle Seahawks @ Green Bay Packer</h6>
        <p>"Start your Seahawks this week. Wilson, Rawls, Graham and Baldwin for sure. Aaron Rodgers will put up consistent but not earth shattering points. No to all GB running backs. Jordy Nelson I think yes. He is playing well, the game is at Lambeu, start him. Davante Adams also. Randall Cobb as a flex option at most."</p>

        <h6>Atlanta Falcons @ Los Angeles Rams</h6>
        <p>"I believe in this Falcons offense. Start Ryan. Start Freeman. Obviously start Julio. Coleman is riskier, but still worth starting if you are searching for one. Taylor Gabriel is in the same boat. I would avoid all Rams this week. I know they are against a bad Falcons D, but their offense is not reliable. This is not the week to gamble on it."</p>

        <h6>New Orleans Saints @ Tampa Bay Buccaneers</h6>
        <p>"Start Brees. Sit Ingram. Thomas and Cooks are both riskier than you might think. The Bucs are hot right now. Thomas, Cooks and Snead take points away from each other. The risk all three carry this week could decide your matchup. I say Cooks and Thomas are worth starting if you are low on effective WRs. Be cautious however. Fleener should do your TE job adequetely enough. Start Winston. Avoid the Buccaneers RBs. Mike Evans is a top top starter this week. Cameron Brate yes."</p>

        <h6>Dallas Cowboys @ New York Giants</h6>
        <p>"This is a tough one. I say Prescott is a decent start this week. Elliott is always a must start. Play Cole Beasley. Play Dez Bryant. Jason Witten might be a sleeper TE if you need one. Eli Manning should give you some good numbers this week. Drop Rashad Jennings this week. The Cowboys run D is good. Odell Beckham definitely start. Sterling Shepard has been good all season. Keep him in your lineup."</p>

        <h6>Baltimore Ravens @ New England Patriots</h6>
        <p>"The Ravens tend to provide a tough matchup for Belechik. Nonetheless, sit Flacco this week. Terrence West is a definite sit. The Ravens offense should not put up big numbers this week.        Baltimore has an excellent run D and a below average pass D. Start Brady and Edelman. Start Amendola if you want a pretty deep sleeper. Martellus Bennett is a good TE start."</p>
